## Requirements

*   Java 8+
*   Maven 3.0+
*   Pod at least at 1.45
*   A certificate for your extension app (with the Subject common name matching app ID) with signing cert uploaded to the pod [More Info](https://extension-api.symphony.com/docs/application-authentication)

*   **app-auth-example** project from Symphony Foundation [Click Here](https://github.com/symphonyoss/app-auth-example) 
	
	
## Integration Steps

Follow these steps to integrate the click to call feature:

*   Download the **app-auth-example** spring boot project and go over its **READ ME** doc to deploy and start the application. 
*   Copy the file **c2c_controller.js** and **index_c2c.html** src/main/resources/static from this project to **app-auth-example/src/main/resources/static/** in **app-auth-example** 
*   Update the java classes below in **app-auth-example** to return logged in user Work Phone number.
	
#### LoginResponse.java

        //Add new property to return logged in user phone
		private String workphone;


#### AuthenticationService.java

		//Modify the method **getUserFromJwt** to return user map as below
		public Map getUserFromJwt(String jwt, String companyId)
		return userMap;
		
		//Comment the below line of code
		//return (String) userMap.get("username");


#### AuthenticationController.java

		@RequestMapping(method = POST, path = "/login-with-jwt")
		public ResponseEntity<LoginResponse> login(@RequestBody JwtLoginRequest request)
		--Set the user wrokphone from jwt token in the login response object
		response.setWorkphone((String)userMap.get("workPhone"));
		

*	Implement the **makeCall(userPhone, contactPhone)** javascript method in **c2c_controller.js** to invoke ajax call to your **Enterprise Telephony API**

#### c2c_controller.js
		
		//MUST Implement this method to invoke your Enterprise Telephony APIs
		function makeCall(userPhone, contactPhone)
		{	
			 var callData = {fromNumber:userPhone, toNumber: concatcPhone };	
			 
			 //Calling Enterprise Telephony API example below
			 ajax.call('/makeCall', callData , 'POST', 'application/json')
				.then(function(data)	{
					console.log(data);
			 });
		}


## Additional Best Practices

Please find the following best-practices when implementing the API:

*	Adding authentication to REST Services in Spring BOOT.
*	Logging usage data.
*	Based on the server load have multiple server instances of the application.
